## Principles of Remote Sensing

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Remote sensing refers to the activities of recording, observing, and perceiving (sensing) objects or events in far-away (remote) places.
-   In remote sensing, the sensors are not in direct contact with the objects or events being observed.
-   Electromagnetic radiation normally is used as the information carrier in remote sensing.
-   The output of a remote sensing system is usually an image representing the scene being observed.
-   A further step of image analysis and interpretation is required to extract useful information from the image.

### History of remote sensing

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The use of aerial Earth survey has started immediately with the invention of the photographic method.
-   The first aerial photograph was taken by Gaspard-Félix Tournachon (known by the pseudonym Nadar) in 1858. It was a picture of a village near Paris captured from a balloon at an altitude of 80 m.

### History of remote sensing: pigeon photographer method

In 1907, Julius Neubronner, a pharmacist, invented the pigeon photographer method for aerial photography. Initially, he used carrier pigeons to deliver medicines, and then he decided to make an experiment designing an aluminium chest harness with minicamera for pigeons, which took automatic photos at regular intervals. Subsequently, in 1909, Neubronner sold some of such pigeon photography images turned into postcards.

### History of remote sensing: aerial photographs

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Aerial photographs started to be taken from planes in 1909.
-   Aerial photography was used during the World War I in military intelligence.
-   The period between the two world wars was marked with the development of methods for civil application of aerial photography, first of all in cartography, geology, agriculture and forestry.
-   Cameras, films and aircrafts improved along with significant development of stereographic mapping method.

### History of remote sensing: space

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Exploration of the outer space was the revolutionary step in the development of remote sensing techniques.
-   Manned spacecrafts, artificial Earth satellites and orbital stations started to deliver extensively satellite images.
-   The first photographs of ground surface have been captured by TIROS weather satellite and Mercury 1--4 spacecrafts in 1960--1962.
-   Image on the right shows the first space photograph taken in 1946. The image captures Mexico.

### History of remote sensing: Earth observation drone

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Although drone was first introduced in the early 1970s, civilian applications of drone only gaining attention since 2016.
-   Earth observation drone for urban analysis, on the other hand, is a very recent area of research.

## Physical Principles of Remote Sensing

### Electromagnetic Radiation

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Electromagnetic spectrum is a system, which "classifies all energy by wavelengths (from short wavelength cosmic energy to long wavelength radio waves) that travel harmonically with constant speed of light" (NASA, 2013).

### Spectrum

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
-   The range of electromagnetic waves with different frequencies is called a spectrum.
-   The following ranges of electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet, visible, infrared, microwave, and radio are used to obtain remote sensing data.
    -   Ultraviolet range (0.1--0.38 μm) is used to assess the state of plants and water reservoirs, and determine the expansion of trace gases and ozone in atmosphere.
    -   Visible (0.38--0.74 μm) range and infrared (0.75--1000 μm), which is divided into three types due to its wide range: near-infrared (0.75--1.5 μm), intermediate (1.5--3 μm) and far-infrared (3--1000 μm) radiation. Near-infrared and visible ranges are widely used to obtain images of forest areas.
    -   Thermal range (2.5 μm --- 1 mm) provides information on the heat field. It has been shown that the temperature difference can reach several degrees in different types of vegetation, plantations of different densities, composition and age, in the surface layer, at the level of the surface and in the soil.

-   Microwave radiation (1 mm --- 1 m) range provides information about topographic characteristics of territories and water zones, deposits of moisture in soil and plant leaves, effects of industrial emission on plants.
-   Radio frequency range (1 m --- \> 10 km) provides information about the underlying terrain. It allows for analysis of the relief of the territory, identification of hazardous natural processes, such as mudflows, landslides etc. Radar photography is possible under any weather conditions and at any time of the day.

### Passive and Active Remote Sensing

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
RS system measuring natural emission operates with passive remote sensing. Accordingly, this system can sense only when there is natural emission available:

-   during the day --- in the visible range;
-   during the day and at night --- in thermal infrared and microwave range.
