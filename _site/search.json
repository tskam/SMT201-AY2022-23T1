One type of multi-band raster dataset that is familiar to many of us is a color image. A basic color image consists of three bands: red, green, and blue. Each band represents light reflected from the red, green or blue portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The pixel brightness for each band, when composited creates the colors that we see in an image.\n### Raster Data Format\n.large[\n- [GeoTIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF): TIFF variant enriched with GIS relevant metadata.\n- [JPEG2000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG2000): Open-source raster format.

It provides a location reference to the geospatial data.\n- A coordinate system is a reference system used to represent the locations of geographic features, imagery, and observations such as GPS locations within a common geographic framework.\n- Each coordinate system is defined by:\n\nIts measurement framework which is either geographic (in which spherical coordinates are measured from the earth’s center) or planimetric (in which the earth’s coordinates are projected onto a two-dimensional planar surface).\nUnit of measurement (typically feet or meters for projected coordinate systems or decimal degrees for latitude–longitude).\nThe definition of the map projection for projected coordinate systems.\nOther measurement system properties such as a spheroid of reference, a datum, and projection parameters like one or more standard parallels, a central meridian, and possible shifts in the x- and y-directions.\n\n- There are two common types of coordinate systems used in mapping, namely: **geographic coordinate systems** and **projected coordinate system**.\n### Geographical Coordinate Systems\n.center[\n![](img/image2-18.jpg)]\n.small[Reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection]\n???\nGCS define locations on the earth using a three-dimensional spherical surface. For example, WGS84\nThey provides accuracy position information. Unit of measurement will be in either decimal degree or degree-minute-second format.\nGCS, however, are not appropriate for distance and area measurements. In this figure, it is clear that 1 degree distance at the north pole is relatively shorter than 1 degree at the equator.\n### Projected Coordinate Systems\n.large[\n- Based on a map projection such as transverse Mercator, Albers equal area, or Robinson.\n]\n.center[\n![:scale 85%](img/image2-19.jpg)]\n???\nA **projected coordinate system** based on a map projection such as transverse Mercator, Albers equal area, or Robinson, all of which (along with numerous other map projection models) provide various mechanisms to project maps of the earth’s spherical surface onto a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate plane.\nProjected coordinate systems are sometimes referred to as **map projections**. For example, SVY21, the national projected coordinate system of Singapore.\nPCS provides consistent length and area measurement across space. Hence, it is important to transform a geospatial data from GCS to PCS before performing geospatial analysis.\n### Singapore Projected Coordinate System\n.center[\n![:scale 60%](img/image2-20.jpg)]\n.large[\n- [epsg.io](https://epsg.io/) provides a comprehensive list of country coordinate systems such as [svy21](https://epsg.io/3414).\n]\n???\nEach country will have her own projected coordinate system. Some country have more than one type of Project Coordinate Systems.\nThere are at least three coordinate systems commonly used in Singapore. They are svy21, Kertau Cassini 1968, and Rectified Skewed Orthomorphic (RSO). RSO is used in military and topographical mapping and svy21 is used for land and engineering surveying, cadastre, landuse and infrastructure mapping.\n### EPSG Reference System\n.large[\nLink to [epsg.io](https://epsg.io/)\n]\n.center[\n![](img/image2-21.jpg)\n]\n???\nThe EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset is a structured dataset of Coordinate Reference Systems and Coordinate Transformations. In 2005, OGP absorbed the European Petroleum Survey Group or EPSG, (1986–2005) into its structure.\nEPSG was a scientific organization with ties to the European petroleum industry consisting of specialists working in applied geodesy, surveying, and cartography related to oil exploration. EPSG compiled and disseminated the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Set, a widely used database of Earth ellipsoids, geodetic datums, geographic and projected coordinate systems, units of measurement, etc.\n### What is geocoding\n- Reference data: features with address attributes\nPoints, lines, polygons.\n.center[\n![:scale 85%](img/image2-22.jpg)\n.small[Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding\n]]\n???\nGeocoding styles\nWhen geocoding an address, a geocoding service searches through the features in the reference data feature class to find the feature with address attributes that most closely match the address. The geometry of the matching feature is then used to create geometry for the address. Geocoding services can further use other types of reference data, such as alternate street name tables and place name alias tables. Some of the styles available are:\nSingle field geocoding service style\nUS One Address geocoding service style\nUS One Range geocoding service style\nUS Streets geocoding service style\nZIP geocoding service style\nZIP+4 geocoding service style\nZIP+4 Range geocoding service style\nUS Alphanumeric Ranges geocoding service style\nUS Hyphenated Ranges geocoding service style\nUS Cities with State geocoding service style\nWorld Cities with Country geocoding service style\n### GeoHash\n.pull-left[\n.large[\n- [GeoHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash) is a public domain geocode system invented in 2008 by Gustavo Niemeyer.\n- For more information, visit this [link](https://www.pubnub.com/learn/glossary/what-is-geohashing/) and\n]]\n.pull-right[\n.large[GeoHash of Singapore]\n![](img/image2-23.jpg)\n.small[\nSource: https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/geohash.html\n]]\n???\nIt encodes a geographic location into a short string of letters and digits.\nIt is a hierarchical spatial data structure which subdivides space into buckets of grid shape, which is one of the many applications of what is known as a Z-order curve, and generally space-filling curves. (http://geohash.gofreerange.com/)\n### Geocoding in Singapore: SLA’s Address-Point Data\n.center[\n![:scale 70%](img/image2-24.jpg)\n]\n### Structure of SLA’s Address-Point data\n.center[\n![:scale 75%](img/image2-25.jpg)\n]\n???\nIt is important to note that the 6-digit postal code used in Address-point data is in character data type and not numerical data type. This is because at downtown area such as Outram Plannign subzone, the postal codes start with 0, as a result, if numeric data type is used. These postal codes will truncated into five digits.\n### [SLA Onemap Geocoding API](https://www.onemap.gov.sg/docs/#onemap-rest-apis)\n.center[\n![:scale 70%](img/image2-26.jpg)\n]\n### Geocoding options for QGIS users\n- Geocode Tools of [MMQGIS](https://michaelminn.com/linux/mmqgis/) plugin.\n.center[\n![:scale 60%](img/image2-27.jpg)\n]\n## Sources of GIS data\n.vlarge[\n- Field surveying\n\nConventional land surveying\nGPS surveying\n\n- Digitising\n- Remote sensing\n\nAirborn\nSatellite\n\n- Digital data\n\nInternet map services\nOpen Data.gov\n\n]\n### Field surveying\n.center[\n![:scale 65%](img/image2-28.jpg)\n]\n### Digitising\n.center[\n![](img/image2-29.jpg)\n]\n### Remotely Sensed Data\n.center[\n![:scale 85%](img/image2-30.jpg)\n]\n### Geospatial Digital Data from SLA\n.center[\n![:scale 75%](img/image2-31.jpg)\n]\n.small[Reference: http://www.asiageospatialforum.org/2011/proceeding/pps/leekim.pdf]\n### Geospatial Digital Data from Open Gov\n.pull-left[\n[data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/)\n![](img/image2-32a.jpg)\n]\n.pull-right[\n[LTA DataMall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html)\n![](img/image2-32b.jpg)\n]\n### OpenStreetMap (OSM)\n.center[\n![:scale 80%](img/image2-33.jpg)\n]\n- To learn more about OSM Singapore, visit this [link](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Singapore).\n- To obtain the latest OSM extract for Singapore, visit this [link](http://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/Singapore/)\n### Open Global Digital Data\n.pull-left[\n[Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/)\n![:scale 85%](img/image2-34a.jpg)\n]\n.pull-right[\n[GDAM: Global Administration Boundary Maps](https://gadm.org/)\n![](img/image2-34b.jpg)]"
