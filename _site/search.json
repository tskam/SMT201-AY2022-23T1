In this lesson, we will mainly focus on vector and raster data models. This is followed by explaining two important concepts of geospatial data, namely: georeferencing and geocoding. Lastly, I will share with you how and where we can find geospatial data."

GIS with its capability to capture, manage, display, and analyse information spatially is emerging as one of the important enabling tool in smart city planning.\nThis course provides students with an introduction to practical applications of GIS in smart city management and planning. Emphasis will be placed on:\n\nlocating, acquiring and integrating multi-sources of data into GIS,\nunderstand the principles and methodologies of geocoding and geo referencing ,\nbecome familiar with geovisualisation and GIS analysis techniques, and\nexplore the technologies and possibilities of GIS-enabled Planning Support Systems for smart city management."
